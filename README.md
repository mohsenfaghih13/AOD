At this stage, I have implemented a basic Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for solving the 2D advection-diffusion equation.
I have not yet added the evaluation section.
In this version, I used constant coefficients for the velocity field (vx = 1.0, vy = 0.5) and diffusion (D = 0.01),
and I assumed a zero source function.
No real sensor data and real lat, lon points have been used at this stage.
